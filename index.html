<h2><a href="http://192.168.5.1">MG8702 Motorolla Gateway</a></h2>
<pre>
This box is wired to the Comcast network connection over Coax cable.
It provides a DHCP server which assigns IP addresses to every device on the MacHome network.
This broadcasts the wireless access point "MacHome 2.4ghz".
Located near air vent in living room.

IP address is self-assigned.
IP address = 192.168.5.1

NOTE:
  There is an analog timer attached to the power supply for the Gateway.
  When set to the correct time it will power-cycle the Gateway between 2 AM and 3 AM.
  If a power outage occurs the time will on the timer will need to be corrected by
  rotating the dial until the arrow points to the current time.

  This power-cycling schedule prevents Comcast from randomly dropping packets
  after 2-3 weeks of continuous connection to their network.
